### Future for the project || How to set up Java

    1. This is it and just serves as my own stepping stone looking back on while progressing.
        - To set up Java!
        
    2. First install Java from oracle for your system.
      - Make sure Java is on path! You can do it trhought the command line or windows envoironments.
        - Just put that in the search bar and look up the usal path for Java for your system.
        - Want to add path throught command line. Example, open command prompt "set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin"

    3. Make a Java project.
      - Command promt "javac Hello.java"
        - Open project "java Hello"
